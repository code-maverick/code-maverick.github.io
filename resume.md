# Introduction
Hi, I'm Tyler Benfield.

I'm currently a Software Developer at SentryOne in Charlotte, NC.
I am lucky to be able to work with a team of brilliant individuals that challenge me to learn new things and improve every day.
Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with and learning new technologies and frameworks to stay up-to-date on where the industry is headed and how we can continue to progress forward.
I also have a few side projects that I work on when I can and I enjoy working on cars as well.

If you'd like to chat, you can reach me at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

# Interesting Topics
Some current topics I find particularly interesting are GraphQL, Web Assembly, and CSS-in-JS.
I have implemented a GraphQL API in C# and continue to find ways in which the schema provides opportunity that REST-like could not.
I have yet to build a product with WebAssembly, but I am following a few and look forward to using it myself once I find the right project.
The controversial nature of CSS-in-JS is something I also follow, although I find both sides tend to misunderstand each other.

I closely follow the React community and I am working to increase my participation and contribution.
Having done React development since 2015, I have seen the library mature and the community surrounding it reach an impressive size.
I'm always impressed by how the maintainers consider real-world applications in any decisions they make, particularly by focusing on backwards compatibility and opt-in new features.

As for languages, my favorite is Go for its performance and straightforward syntax, but I rarely have the opportunity to use it professionally.
I have dove headfirst into TypeScript and really enjoy it.
The next language I hope to learn is ReasonML, specifically focusing on ReasonReact.

# Projects
## Jest Test Adapter VS Code Extension
* [GitHub](https://github.com/rtbenfield/vscode-jest-test-adapter)
* [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rtbenfield.vscode-jest-test-adapter)

After finding a few things I did not like about existing Jest VS Code extensions and discoverin gthat surprisingly few existed, I began a project to scratch my own itch that is now a published VS Code extension.
It is not a complete extension on its own, but an adapter to extend the functionality of the [Test Explorer UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer) extension by Holger Benl.
It is still in an early preview, but I have been shocked by the number of installs and amount of feedback.

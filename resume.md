# Introduction
Hi, I'm Tyler Benfield.

I'm currently a Solutions Architect at Standpoint Technologies in Huntersville, NC.
Most of my job consists of building and maintaining JobPro, a job management software with a focus on the insulation subcontractor industry.
Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with and learning new technologies and frameworks to stay up-to-date on where the industry is headed and how we can improve the products we build at Standpoint.
I'm also a basketball fan and enjoy working on cars.

If you'd like to chat, you can reach me at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

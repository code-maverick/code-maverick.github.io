Hello, world. My name is Tyler Benfield. I am a solutions engineer with [Standpoint Technologies](http://www.standpointtech.com/) in Huntersville, NC. I recently decided to start a blog to log the things I have learned along the way. Don't expect too much, though, as I am not trying to take the place of many of the very intelligent men and women that have blogs on topics they have spent their lives studying and using. Instead, I'll be trying to compile some of the knowledge I gain that I think may help others. In some cases this may be as simple as sharing a link. Sometimes I may compile a list of sources into a step-by-step process. Other times I may just rant about things. Oh, and please, if you have any suggestions to go along with my posts, or maybe have a better way of doing things, feel free to express your thoughts. I appreciate constructive and destructive criticism alike. Let's learn together.

Hi, I'm Tyler Benfield.
I'm currently a softawre developer at [SentryOne](https://www.sentryone.com/).
I completed my Bachelor's degree at Wingate University and my Master's in Georgia Tech's [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) program.
I started this blog to catalog the things I learn as I continue to discover more concise and efficient ways to write code and build complex systems.
If you're interested in my skillsets, check out my resum√©.
If you're interested in my projects, check out my Github page.

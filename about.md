Hi, I'm Tyler Benfield. I'm a solutions engineer at [Standpoint Technologies](http://www.standpointtech.com/). I completed my Bachelor's degree at Wingate University and I'm currently in Georgia Tech's [OMSCS](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) program. I started this blog to catalog the things I learn as I continue to discover more concise and efficient ways to structure code. If you're interested in my skillsets, check out my resum√©. If you're interested in my projects, check out my Github page.

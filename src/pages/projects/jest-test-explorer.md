After finding a few things I did not like about existing Jest VS Code extensions and discovering that surprisingly few existed,
I began a project to scratch my own itch that is now a published VS Code extension.
It is not a complete extension on its own, but an adapter to extend the functionality of the
[Test Explorer UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer) extension by Holger Benl.
It is still in an early preview, but I have been shocked by the number of installs and amount of feedback.
